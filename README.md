# Bladder-Tissue-Classification-using-CNN
## Synopsis

Implemented and trained convolutional neural network(CNN) from scratch using matlab and keras with tensorflow
back-end to classify bladder pathology image regions into soft tissue, muscle, and tumor. Applied patch based classification as size of pathology images is very large. Evaluated CNN and CNN + Support Vector Machine(SVM)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
